/*
 * Stub for legacy product-addons.js.
 *
 * The add-on builder logic has been moved into dedicated modules under
 * the js/addons directory: data.js, utils.js, fields.js, config.js and
 * builder.js. These modules collectively provide the same
 * functionality as the original large script but in a modular form.
 * Please update your HTML pages to import the appropriate modules
 * directly instead of relying on this file. When loaded, this stub
 * simply logs a deprecation warning to the console.
