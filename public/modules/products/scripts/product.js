/*
 * Stub for legacy product.js.
 *
 * The original monolithic product.js has been refactored into several
 * smaller modules located in the js/product directory (addon-ui.js,
 * seo-utils.js, layout-main.js, layout-extra.js, checkout.js and
 * main.js). Those modules should be included individually in your
 * HTML via separate <script type="module"> tags. This stub remains
 * solely for backwards compatibility and will emit a console warning
 * if loaded. No functional code resides here.
